# Decisions

Any important decisions -- big or small; technical, design or otherwise -- have been captured here in this decision repository.

The are a few intentions:

- To provide the plugin developers with a reference as to why particular decisions were made and the thought process that lead to them.
- To help potential contributors get in to the mindset of the plugin developers -- by reading the decisions already made, you can get a feel for the direction and vision of the project.
- To be revisited in the future when looking for potential enhancements -- often decisions made won't be perfect first time due to limitations of time, effort, knowledge or understanding of the domain.

## Format

Each decision has been written in a format akin to the [MADR (Markdown Any Decision Records) template][madr].
